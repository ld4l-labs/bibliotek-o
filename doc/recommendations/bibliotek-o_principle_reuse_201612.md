**LD4L Labs / LD4P Ontology Group**

**December 2016**

Based on impression of the LD4L Labs / LD4P Ontology Group, the Library
of Congress is unlikely to reuse external classes/properties in place of
BIBFRAME resources. However, they are open to other forms of external
ontology alignment in BIBFRAME, and revisiting the reuse option in the
future when they are more comfortable with the stability of external
ontologies.

**The LD4L Labs / LD4P Ontology Group recommends:**

1.  Use BIBFRAME for core resources and default to BIBFRAME usage for as
    > many fragments as the LD4L Labs / LD4P Ontology Group considers
    > feasible.

2.  Recommend for reuse to Library of Congress, and if not approved,
    > reuse as part of bibliotek-o, external ontology fragments where
    > the external ontology fragment is equivalent (or improves) the
    > replaced BIBFRAME 2.0 ontology fragment.

3.  Send recommendations to the Library of Congress for external
    > ontology reuse and other forms of external ontology alignment
    > within the BIBFRAME ontology.

For most patterns, the LD4L Labs / LD4P Ontology Group and the LD4P
Ontology Extension Groups will need to consider external ontology
fragments on a case-by-case basis; this recommendation is meant to help
guide decisions and options considered at that time.

Recommended Approach for Moving Forward
=======================================

Reuse & Alignment recommendation steps include:

1.  Aim for external ontology fragment reuse/import into BIBFRAME;

2.  If not the above, aim for external ontology fragment reuse/import
    > into bibliotek-o or recommendation to simply use the external
    > ontology fragment with BIBFRAME;

3.  If not the above, upon agreement with ontology or namespace owners
    > affected, declare equivalences between relevant external ontology
    > fragments and BIBFRAME (and/or bibliotek-o) fragments.

4.  []{#_30j0zll .anchor}If not the above, declare
    > subclasses/subproperties between external ontology fragments and
    > BIBFRAME (and/or bibliotek-o) fragments
